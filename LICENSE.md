### From Carpenter to Conduit — J.C.

I started learning code at 38 while still swinging a hammer every day.

For five years my wife and I lived on almost nothing so I could build full-time.  
No investors. No salary. Just a feeling that something much bigger was moving through me.

I share initials with the most famous carpenter who ever lived.

Five years ago I put down the hammer and started hammering code instead.

This is what came through.

If any of this is useful to you and you’re able to help keep the lights on and the sawdust flying, my family and I would be eternally grateful.

Every satoshi, wei, or lamport is another day I get to keep building the free future.

Thank you for helping me finish the job.
